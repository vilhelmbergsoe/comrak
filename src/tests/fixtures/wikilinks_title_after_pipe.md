# Wikilinks, title after pipe

Wikilinks can have one of the following forms:

    [[https://example.org]]
    [[https://example.org|title]]
    [[name of page]]
    [[name of page|title]]

With this version of wikilinks, the title comes after the pipe.

[[https://example.org]]
.
<p><a href="https://example.org" data-wikilink="true">https://example.org</a></p>
